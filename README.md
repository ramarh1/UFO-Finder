# UFO Finder: Module 11 Challenge 

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analyis is to create a webpage using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and a dynamic table that allows users to search for UFO sightings as well as filter the date, city, state, country, and shape at the same time. 

## Results
Users can perform searches using the date, using the MM/DD/YYYY format, the shape of the UFO, or the country, state, or city of the sighting simultaneously. One important thing to mention is that the text queries have to be in lowercase and use the abbreviated names of states and countries.

## Summary
One drawback of this webpage is that the query only takes text queries for the city, state, and country in lowercase,and when uppercase is used, the filter doesn't work. One suggestion would be to allow abbreviated names of locations as well as the full names. Another suggestion to improve the webpage would be to allow uppercase, or any other type of font case when filtering different sightings. It would make the filtering more flexible and user-friendly.
